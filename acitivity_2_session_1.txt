What does the model achieve?
- estimates the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable using a straight line.

How should metrics be interpreted?
- Slope is the relationship between temperature and the expansion of mercury in a thermometer.

What are appropriate use cases?
- It means that we can use mercury thermometers to measure temperature.

How is it implemented? 
- It is assumed that the two variables are linearly related

What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?
- It is a fake data and chart, so it is better to apply in real situations

How to interpret this specific result and advising action/next steps
 - It is a certain linear relationship that we can tell that as temperature increases, the mercury expands.
